**Build a RESTful API with Express.js and MongoDB**

## What is this lesson about?
This lesson is about building a RESTful API with Express.js and MongoDB. We will build a simple API that will allow us to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data. We will also learn how to secure our API with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

## What you will learn
* Build a RESTful API with Express.js
* Use MongoDB to store data
* Secure your API with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
* Use Mongoose to model your data
* Use Postman to test your API

* Chapter 1, Getting Started, will get you up and running with the project
* Chapter 2, Building the API, will walk you through building the API
* Chapter 3, Securing the API, will show you how to secure your API with JWTs
* Chapter 4, Testing the API, will show you how to test your API with Postman
